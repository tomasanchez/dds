## What is Designing?

**Problem Solving**

`Problem -> Bulding -> Solution -> Information System`

**Software** _vs_ **Information System**

### Designing a System

`Analysis -> Problem understanding -> Requirements definitions -> Designing solution shape`

Designis is

- Evaluate alternativas
- Ponderate Qualities
- Take decisions

#### Systems' Definition

- Components
  - Funtionalities/objects/classes
- Responsabilities
  - What thing is solved by what
- Relationships
  - Interactions

## Architecture & Methodology

### Development Metholodogy

Iterative and Incremental.

In each iteration adds valueto the product.

### Architecture

- Presentation: User interaction
- Domain
- Persistency: Focus on data storage

Technology will go trhough the design. Even though a design must not be married to a technology, it must be aware of it.
